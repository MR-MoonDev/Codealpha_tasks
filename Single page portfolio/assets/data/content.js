 Hello! I am Muhammad Muneeb ul Raza. I am a passionate 21 year old undergraduate of Computer Science at Government College University, Hyderabad. Technology has always been my favorite subject, and I also love doing web development, android app development and educational tutoring.  

In the field of web and mobile development, I combine my creativity with technical skills. I am obsessed with brainstorming and coming up with new ideas that could improve user experience and provide a solution to problems. Other than technical in nature, I love education and work as a home tutor to promote education within my community.  

As of now, I am focused towards learning something new along with the education which I am currently having and would always be looking forward towards any other skill that helps me contribute in the field of technology.
